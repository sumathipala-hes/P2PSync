- ✅ **File Transfer Protocol** - Socket-based file transfer with progress tracking
- ✅ **Material Design UI** - Modern Android UI with folder selection and sync controls
- ✅ **Comprehensive Permissions** - All required WiFi Direct and storage permissions
- ✅ **Error Handling** - Robust error handling throughout the application
- ✅ **Progress Tracking** - Real-time transfer progress with visual feedback

### Architecture Components

#### Main Classes

1. **MainActivity.kt** - Main activity with WiFi Direct integration and UI controls
2. **P2PConnectionManager.kt** - Manages WiFi Direct connections and device discovery
3. **P2PFileTransfer.kt** - Handles file transfer over socket connections
4. **WiFiDirectBroadcastReceiver.kt** - Processes WiFi P2P system events
5. **P2PDevice.kt** - Data class representing discovered P2P devices

#### Key Features

- **Device Discovery**: Scans for nearby WiFi Direct devices
- **Connection Establishment**: Automatically handles group formation
- **File Transfer**: Creates test files and transfers them over P2P connection
- **Progress Monitoring**: Shows real-time transfer progress
- **Folder Selection**: Uses Storage Access Framework for modern Android compatibility

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### WiFi Direct Integration

```kotlin
// Core WiFi Direct components implemented:
- WifiP2pManager for P2P operations
- WifiP2pManager.Channel for communication
- WiFiDirectBroadcastReceiver for system events
- P2PConnectionManager for device management
- P2PFileTransfer for file operations
```

### Permissions Configured

```xml
<!-- All required permissions added to AndroidManifest.xml -->
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CHANGE_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.NEARBY_WIFI_DEVICES" />
<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.wifi.direct" android:required="true"/>
```

### Build Configuration

- **Target SDK**: 35 (Android 16) - meets Google Play requirements
- **Compile SDK**: 35
- **Min SDK**: 24 (Android 7.0)
- **Build Status**: ✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s

## 📱 User Experience Flow

1. **Launch App** → Permissions requested automatically
2. **Discover Devices** → Scan for nearby WiFi Direct devices
3. **Select Device** → Choose from discovered devices dialog
4. **Connect** → Automatic group formation and connection
5. **Select Folder** → Choose sync folder using file picker
6. **Start Sync** → Transfer test files with progress tracking
7. **Complete** → Success notification and ready for next sync

## 🚀 Installation & Testing

### Current Status

- ✅ **APK Built**: Successfully compiled without errors
- ✅ **APK Installed**: Deployed to Pixel_7(AVD) - 16 emulator
- ✅ **App Launches**: No runtime errors, all UI components functional
- ✅ **Permissions**: All WiFi Direct permissions properly configured

### Testing Recommendations

#### Emulator Testing (Current)

- Basic UI functionality verified
- Permission flows working
- App launches without crashes

#### Physical Device Testing (Recommended Next Steps)

1. Install on two physical Android devices
2. Test WiFi Direct device discovery between devices
3. Verify connection establishment
4. Test actual file transfer functionality
5. Validate transfer progress and completion
